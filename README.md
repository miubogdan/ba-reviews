# British Airways Reviews Analysis with Tableau

## Problem statement
British Airways faces a challenge in fully grasping customer satisfaction due to the difficulty of analyzing vast data. Despite having extensive information, the airline struggles to derive actionable insights, which impacts its decision-making process for service improvement.

## The dashboard

By applying filters like rating type, date, traveler category, seat classification, aircraft group, and geographical region, the dashboard transforms into a multifaceted instrument for detailed examination. It is enhanced with panels that show average ratings selected based on month, country, and aircraft. This feature aids British Airways in identifying specific strengths or areas needing enhancement, supporting decisions based on solid data.
